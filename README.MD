# Deep Archetypal Analysis Frameworks: Comparative Evaluation

## 1. Project Description
Archetypal Analysis (AA) is a matrix decomposition technique representing data points as a convex combination of extreme data points, referred to as archetypes. By capturing boundary patterns, AA provides a geometric description that enhances interpretability, especially in high-dimensional settings. This repository evaluates the trade-offs between classical Linear AA, the non-linear AAnet and MIDAA.
